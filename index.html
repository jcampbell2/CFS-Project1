      <p>My name is Jack Campbell, and I am proud father of two wonderful children.  I enjoy watching movies and television shows with my family.  In my free time I train as a martial artist, specializing in Tai-Kwon-Do.</p>

      <h1>My Background</h1>

      <p>I have worked as a carpenter in Northwest Indiana since I was 15 years old.  I recently decided to learn a new skill.  I am currently attending Coder Camps to learn to be a Web Developer.</p>

      <h1>Why Programming?</h1>

      <p>Programming, especially video game design, has been an interest of mine since the early 80's.  Now that I am getting older, I have decided to change into a career that could lead me to my childhood dream of being a video game designer.</p>
